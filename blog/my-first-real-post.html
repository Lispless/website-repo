    <h1>My First Real Blog Post</h1>
    <p>Welcome, readers.  I think I've made enough of the site to not be completely embarassed by it.  I still don't have a domain name, so I hope the belligerent git pages thing isn't that big of a deal.  I would like to have a domain name, but I honestly can't afford it.  I am grateful that git pages exists and that I can build a site using it.  I'm going to try my hardest to make an awesome static page with all the free tools available.</p>

    <p>That reminds me, this is my firt time using SASS.  Right now I'm enjoying nesting elements and am anxious to start incorporating variables.  The server I'm using to preview the site doesn't follow the same paths as Chrome does, so there are little things here and there that are causing hiccups.  I either need a better tool or learn this one better.  Right now, I'm excited to build this site and begin to consolidate my works.</p>

    <p>For now, I apologize that I don't have the place furnished yet, but it is coming along.  There will come a day though, that you can come along and post comments and all that good stuff.  I will try to get a comic up so you can glance at it and utter a half-approving chortle.  Now, the projects page; this is going to have to look really nice (or at least, I want it to).  I am still in deep contemplation about how projects is going to look.  I'm almost thinking tiles, despite my disdain of their dreaded design.  Hm.  Not sure.  Either way, if you have any input or notice anything that is amiss, please <a href="about.html">send me a message</a> and I'll do my best to return you correspondence and repair the site.  If you notice a typo, please, PLEASE let me know, I will be exceedingly gratefull.</p>

    <p>-Best wishes,</p>
    <p>Kurt Henry</p>
