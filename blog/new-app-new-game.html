    <h1>New App, New Game</h1>
    <p>It's been a while since my last post, but I am back.  I have a lot of activities and a lot of projects I would like to work on.  My most recent ambition is creating a new game.  I've requested (cajoled) my good friend, Peaches into helping me out.  He has the uncanny acumen for excellent level and map design.  We have plans for a fun story and engaging characters.  Before we start on the main course, though, we will be creating a bare bones rpg to familiarize ourselves w/ the software we'll be using.</p>

    <p>We are using a program called RPG Maker MV.  It's a great little program that let's you create rpgs pretty easily.  We made the decision because Enterbrain's publishing policies are very generous and neither Peaches or I have the time or money to build a game from scratch.  I would love love love to create something from scratch, but I think that will mostly depend on how successfull our main game will be.  I'm actually nearing the end of development for the test game, which I've lovingly called 'Save the Princess!  2, Even!'  In my head, we'll release this for free to give people a taste of what we are capable of at what our style is like.  I hope people can be entertained by it for the finve minutes it will take to play through it, and I hope that I can continue on to bigger and better projects.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, my other good friend, KdashAMBI, as about to reveal his novel, YouTube rocking idea to the world!  I've gotten a taste, and it is absolutely needed and fantastically entertaining.  Please visit his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Kdashambi">here</a> and stay tuned, because it's happening soon.  This guy has a heart of gold and desserves all the views he can get, and then some.</p>

    <p>-Best wishes,</p>
    <p>Kurt Henry</p>
