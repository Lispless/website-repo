    <h1>The Dangerous Art of Humility</h1>
    <p>Humility is a life long endeavor.  To me, this is only the first step that must be acknowledged.  Verily, if one comes to regret this realization, any progress is naught.  So, the sooner the better.  Similar to other life long journeys, the journey is rife with perils, hurdles, and tests.  The desicion to undertake each of these journeys must be exceedingly deliberated and excessively reflected upon.  Verily, too many challengers are defeated this early due to rash decisions or impulse; the mere fact that they have decided, or, in an exceedingly passionate wile, had the desicion made for them is evidence enough they are not ready.  Hasty traits and eager gratification belong to those not worth mentioning and must, for their sake, seek to reflect on who they are and what controls their actions.</p>
    <p>Let it be apparent that individuals seeking humility are intrinsically, or have nurtured the traits of patience, selflessness, and are that of strong will.  Let these traits be practiced and natural to out supposition.  Just as humility is an aspiration of the highter mind, it is also an attack on our base, primal instincts.  Patience is the root that firmly tethers us.  Without this foundation we could not faulter in a positive way.  Without patience, our insticts will win; they will dominate our thoughts and perseverance.  The entire structure which patience supports must be able to be ravaged, but never fall.  As our roots grow and gain strength, we can observe that the trunk becomes engorged.  As long as one is patient, they can begin to understand what selflessness is.  The prospects and workings are too numerous to detail here, but be cognizant that this, too, has no end to its length.  As the rings continue to enumerate, we can observe that strong will is only the natural evolution.  As resolve grows and is practiced, it grows more and helps nurish the other traits.</p>
    <p>Now we have grown to a stage where higher thoughts can be meditated on.  We can observe our past and our future.  It does not take much to see the cascading actions of your decisions from here.  It is here that we are mostly free to think and consider upon very deeply about these actions.  It is here that one must resolve to reflect on consternation or conflict.</p>
