Fandom

People are at liberty to consume and enjoy all things at their liesure.  A casual reader, a casuel gamer, the casual chef, the casual anything.  Just because someone can't name all the batman villians or recite all the lore doesn't mean they aren't a fan, right?  Fucking wrong.

People are not fucking fans.  You can't shave your head today and call yourself punk the next.  You don't get to arbitrarily call yourself a fan.  How are these fucks that don't think you have to earn that privilage.  You don't know who Jane Way is?  You aren't a fucking Trekkie.  You don't know who Shepard is?  You aren't a fucking gamer.
