    <h1>Of Ice and Men</h1>
    <p>Hello, and thank you for stumbling upon my humble little blog.  While I wish I could promise you endearing endevors of experiences most whimsy, I instead must warn of the bitter musings most hearted frozen.</p>
    <p>I would never consider myself a negative man.  Nor would I consider myself an optimistic soul.  Instead I am guided by my gut's behest, tempured and reigned by my mind.  More often than not, to my palpable dismay, my feelings and attitude are poorly recieved.  There is an air of rebeliousness sniffed out by the optimist when limits and constraints are enforced.  The pessimist, whom jovially seeks to refute solutions beyond solutions and almost take pride in there almost devious woe are equally obdurate of insight or critique.  It is these traits and nature of resistance that mold the perception of myself as the bad guy.</p>
    <p>As the bad guy, my goals are simple.  To enjoy life, to be productive, to learn, to experience, to explore, the same as everyone else (I imagine).</p>
