    <h1>Star Crissed</h1>
    <p>It wasn't that long ago that I had to accept that Silent Hills was not going to happen.  Verily, the schism between Konami and Hideo Kojima  runs deep, and destroyed a lot of future prospects, mainly anything to do with Metal Gear.  I'm sure people will still be buying Metal Gear products in the future, but not me.  Silent Hills was supposed to not only revitelize the horror genre but, thanks to the talents of Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro, anticipated to be a groundbreaking piece of art.  The loss of something so grandiose, that was once left in the relms of wishful potential, was pretty tragic.  It was dissapointing, agrivating, and soul draining.</p>

    <p>We've had a long time to ruminate the demise of the Silent Hills project, and while it remains a shame just the same, some of the wounds now have scar tissue over them.  It wouldn't be until two days ago that I learned my favorite horror author, Junji Ito was also going to work on Silent Hills.  It was a bitter blow and resurfaced the mourning I felt for the game.  Every single person, Norman Reedus, Hideo Kojima, Guillermo Del Toro, and Junji Ito has so much talent, it's insane.  Knowing that Silent Hills could have been is absolutely one of the single most dissapointing things to happen.  Between this and Chrono Break, my heart aches for stories and experiences I've missed out on.</p>

    <p>-Best wishes,</p>
