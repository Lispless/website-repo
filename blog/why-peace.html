    <p>Who am I?  First, let me tell you about my life.  My life can be summed up pretty concisely with a few choice events.  Allow me to convey one of them; I will attempt to make it brief.  I traveled to a city accross the state I was in to visit some friends.  Despite being poor, I went to take my friends out for sushi.  This sushi joint was in no way cheap.  I park my car and feed the meter.  After getting seated I went to feed the meter some more.  Before I could get back inside the restaurant, a panhandler accosted me.  Normally I ignore them, but for what ever reason I didn't today.  I gave him the rest of my change and finished dinner.  I'm rewarded  will a parking ticket.  I've never believed in karma.  This event is a goed reminder that I'm getting nonstopped fucked in every way.</p>

    <p>Winters.  Winters are the worst.  There's one thin, silver lining to winter though.  It's rare and ephemiral, but it might be the most beautiful event in my life.  I'm lucky if it occurs once a year.  So.  Every once in a while, out of nowhere, I'll notice someone stuggling.  It's not that something is difficult stuggling.  It's, life is a chore struggling.  They are like a bright beacon in a sea of dirty snow, loud sloshing from vehicles, and beat up buildings.  There will be a resplended momemnt in this stranger's life that the current struggle is so palpable that it might be the final straw, as if this straw was being strained and desperate to to remain whole.  I can tell by watching, they show their story in their struggle.  In this moment all the arguments, all the hurtful things they try to repress, the stress from spilling wine on white fabric, embarassment from leaving their fly open, pain from loosing a pet, all the anger from slamming a door on their apendage, all the hate they've ever felt is summoned forth.  As they balance groceries trying to find the lock with their key, their kids are screaming and their phone is ringing.  The key is not finding the mark.  The fucking eggs are about to fall out.  All the hate, all the rage.  It's cold.  Their socks are wet, they haven't eaten, and they just remembered, no, they can't relax when they get home because they told someone they'd be somewhere.  Thoughts transform from one of the greatest things I've ever accomplished as a human being, from it's annoying but I love it, from, why is it my resposibility, to who's FAULT was the kid?  It's not just an accident, it's an affront to their life that needs blame.  Who can I yell at and hate for this blight?  All the times they've been lied to, all the times they've been walked on, told what to do, had to make a sacrifice.  It's cold, they're hungry.  Their vision has blurred the world around them as they are absorbed trying to find the keyhole under they groceries that are about to spill.  Their muscles flare up as tension poisons their body.  Leave the groceries, fuck it.  Leave the kid, fuck it.  Smash your head in, fuck everything.  And then.  And then they drop their keys.  This moment.  The stranger's eyes, their hands as this moment occurs.  It's one of the few times I can relate to people on an almost spiritual level.  They honest to fuck can't summon the will to continue.  They only continue because time doesn't stop.  Welcome to my whole life.</p>
