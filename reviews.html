        <h2>The Good: Alive on Arrival: Deadpool 10/3/16</h2>
        <p>Before I get into the meat of anything, I like to express what my stance is and the feelings and expectations that came before.  What came before was a viscid haze of annoyance.  I'm sick of Fox turning out horrible comic book movies and as a moderate fan of the Deadpool character, I was annoyed that they were going to make another horrible Deadpool live action movie.</p>
        <p>My negative gut reaction was slightly abated when I saw the 'leaked' trailer.  I was initialy impressed how the physics are portrayed and most importantly, how the eyes were animated.  The animated eyes are something that have been so obvious since the days of Adam West, that it is painfully absent not only from modern movies, but from the appreciation of movie goers.  Verily, it may be the signle most underrated element that people didn't realize made the movie so good.  The second chip to succumb happend when I learn that Tim Miller would be directing it.  I had resevations still because he didn't have directing experience (per se).  But, if this was the dude that could convey the beautful effects and stunts I saw in Scott Pilgrim, he is definitely worth giving a shot.  Still reluctant to watch a Fox comic movie, I was sold on April Fools day.  I've been burned before thinking along these lines, but the prank, subsequent stunts with Mario Lopez, and trailers really showed what they were all about.</p>
        <p>(Very)Fortunately for me, putting myself on the line and setting aside my pride payed off.  The fist few seconds set the tone exceptionally well.  Verily, it is a lovingly choreographed long cut of gratuitus comedy and violence.  That's exactly what I payed and was hoping for.  One of the greatest... I'm at a loss for an adequate word, let's say 'stunt'-- stunt the team behind Deadpoll pulled off was showing a lot of the gags from the trailer that are form the beginning of the movie.  This is brilliant because A, they are not the funniest part of the movie, B, in now way gave away plot that wasn't already obvious (even (especially!) parts that weren't at the beginning), and C, the rest of the movie was fresh.  It was great.  It was genius to knock out all the jokes everyong was expecting and have the etire rest of the movie be a clean slate.</p>

          <span>Arbitrary ad!!!</span><span>Haha, can you imagine?</span>

        <p>The comedy, albeit very trite at (seldom) times, was for the most part an absolute treat.  The action, although infrequent, was always top knotch.  The best part about the dicotomy after significant reflection is that the two siblings are so strong, that one could have carried the film without the other.  Would it have been as great?  Obviously not, but if it had lacked one entirely, the movie could have still stood beside what many consider good films.  Having the action and comedy at such an excellent level was an absolute blast.  The other great (I imagine overlooked) and (capitol S here) significant aspect was indeed the physics.  A great example is anything Colossus.  His weightful movement, dull sound effects, and interactions with the environment, objects, and characters conveyed his stature and girth beautifully.  This was the first Fox comic movie I've seen that actually convinced me that these powers and characters existed in the world and operated on a superhuman level.</p>
        <p>As far as negative aspects go, the biggest offender is the obligatory hero's arc.  The only reason I think they adhered to it is that they were forced to make Deadpool as digestible as possible for as big of an audience as possible.  Verily, no one knew if Deadpoll would be successful and had a lot working against it.  In the end, the trope wasn't as terrible as it could have been.  Aside from the action and comedy, all the characters played their roles will and were very endearing.</p>
        <p>In the end, Deadpool was a  very enjoyable experience and I would encourage anyone on the fence about it to go watch it.</p>

        <h2>The Big Lame Theory 30/3/16</h2>
        <p>Have you every seen the sitcom, The Big Bang Theory?  If not, count your lucky stars.  For years I have been listening to positive feedback casual viewers have offered about the show.  Non-casual viewers had a favorable view.  It seems like most people like the show.  I was expecting mediocrity.  Things are seldom as people make them out to be.  What I got was a lot worse.  It is so exceedingly mediocre, that it's egregiously average.  If it's one thing that will ruin a show and especially the satire in it, it's the shallow one dimensional jokes.  "Hey, look at my smart phone!  I still have to charge it or it will allow itself to die, so it can't be that smart!"  Que canned laughter.  Just in case that joke was made on The Big Bang Theory, I have not seen that episode and made that up on the spot; I don't mean to steal jokes and I would not put it past the writing team to come up with it too.  The punchline is the oposite of the delivery.  Not only is this unimaginative, but it's not funny either.  Another instance of desperate comedy writing goes something like this, (conspicuously socially inept character)"Salutations, so-and-so.  While I was eating my daily intake of (mustard and jelly soup/Jell-O sandwich/obligatory odd combination of food), it occured to me as to why a resplendant doxy like Jane might find my particular verbosity to be pernicious at best and precariously portentous at worst.  That's portentous, not to be confused with pretentious, because, as made gratuitously apparent but my humble demeanor and acceptance of people that lack copious mental fortitude, I am never pretentious."  Canned laughter.  Ackward pause.  "Because I'm above that sort of thing."  Canned laughter.  Ackward pause.  "I might be exaggerating."  Laughter, pause.  "That means blowing it our of proportion."  On and on we go.  This type of joke is also lacking intelligence, creativity, and, again, actual humor.</p>
        <p>Because of this lack of well set up jokes and humorous punchlines, there are shows out there that are just as funny, but more entertaining because the writing team had some talent and put thought into the character, situations, and satirical pay offs.  Why anyone would choose to digest such tripe will remain a mystery forever unresolved.  Comedy is the most difficult to write, and I get that.  That doesn't mean shows like this or Friends should ever have made it past the pilot.</p>
